    <h1>DAY 2 of JS Q/A</h1>
    <!-- question 1 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Que.1 What is execution context?
        </div>

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                An environment called the Execution Context that handles the entire memory creation and execution of the
                code.
                During the context runtime, the parser parses the source code and allocates memory for the variables and
                functions.
                The source code is generated and gets executed.

    <!-- question 2 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Que.2 What is an event loop and call stack
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
         <div class="explaination">
           <h3> event loop</h3>
           event loop is stop the callback in the callback queue and micro task queue to going into the call stack
           if any think is present in the call stack.
           <h3> call stack</h3>
            call stack is stack which follows lifo (last in first out) here callbacks and execution context are being push 
           .that top most Execution is show where interpretator is is working on and code is being executed
         </div>
      
        </div>

    <!-- question 3 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Ques.3 What is creation phase and execution phase?
        </div>

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                <h3>creation phase</h3>
              In creation phase memory is being alocated to that scope variable and functions 
              variable with var and simple functions are being inisialized by undefined and let and const 
              variables are with uninisialized
              <h3>execution phase</h3>
              in execution phase code is being executed line by line and when there is any inisialition of variable happen
              than it update the memory in creation phase.

    <!-- question 4 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Ques.4 What is the spread operator?
        </div>

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
 The spread operator ... is used to expand or spread an iterable or an object
 . this do deep copy means here array value are by by values into B 
            </div>
            <pre>
    let a=[5,35,2,6];
    let b=[...a];//value of b is [5,35,2,6]

    <!-- question 5 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Ques.5 What is the use of setTimeout?
        </div>

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
            setTimeout is an asynchonous in nature. it takes 2 parameters 1 is the callback and another is the time in milli second 
            it execute/call the callback function after that that time only once if we want to stop in between then we can use clearTimeout()
            </div>
            <pre>
     var setTime=  setTimeout( ()=>{
         console.log('this is first class funtion');
        },1000);
        clearTimeout(setTime);

    <!-- question 6 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Ques.6 What are callback Hell?
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                Here, every setTimeout() is callback (except the first stetimeout)
                inner setTimeout call after the execution of previous setTimeout
                due to this we can aachive 1 should be printed after 1 sec, 2 should be
                printed after 2 sec, 3 should be printed after 3 sec, and so on.
            </div>
            <pre>
function ques2(){
  setTimeout(() => {
     console.log("1");

         setTimeout(()=>{
             console.log("3");
             setTimeout(()=>{
                 console.log("4");
                 setTimeout(()=>{
                     console.log("5");
                     setTimeout(()=>{
                       console.log("6");

    <!-- question 7 -->
    <div class="container">
        <div class="question">
            Ques.7 What are callbacks?
        </div>

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                when a function is pass as an argument in another function then that function is callback function 
                we can see in the function operation the third parameter is a callback function. We are first passing the
                "callback" as an argument and then calling it inside the parent function
                i.e., operation. Here, we have taken the "sum" as the callback function, we can create any function and pass
                it as the callback in the operation function.
            </div>

            <pre>
function sum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b)
}

function operation(val1, val2, callback) {
  callback(val1, val2)
}

operation(6, 5, sum)
